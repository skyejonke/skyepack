# About

More or less, this is just my personal Minecraft modpack! It'll be kept up to date with the latest version of Minecraft as best I can. Feel free to use it however you'd like!


# Credits

Honestly, most of the mods, and the configuration, were taken directly from [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized). Please check them out!
